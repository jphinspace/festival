# Queue Management Optimizations and Improvements

This document lists potential optimizations and improvements for the queue management system, covering security queues, food stall queues, and shared queue logic.

## Code Style and Architecture

### Completed
- ✅ Separated queue logic into dedicated modules (`queueManager.js`, `queuedProcessor.js`)
- ✅ Shared QueueManager for common operations across queue types
- ✅ Base class pattern (QueuedProcessor) for consistent behavior
- ✅ Proximity-based queue positioning for natural joining behavior
- ✅ Throttled position updates (125ms) to reduce performance overhead
- ✅ Separate "approaching" and "in_queue" states with proper transitions

### Future Improvements
- **Extract queue configuration into dedicated config object**: Move queue-specific constants (QUEUE_SPACING, QUEUE_WAIT_TIME, etc.) into a dedicated queue config
- **Add TypeScript definitions**: Create .d.ts files for queue classes and interfaces
- **Create queue visualization tool**: Add debug mode showing queue positions, approaching fans, processing states
- **Implement queue strategy pattern**: Allow different queue types (FIFO, priority, multi-stage) to be swapped easily
- **Add queue event system**: Emit events for queue join, leave, processing start/complete for better debugging
- **Separate queue rendering logic**: Extract queue visualization from queue logic for better separation of concerns
- **Queue position pooling**: Reuse position objects instead of creating new ones
- **Abstract queue shapes**: Support different queue geometries (straight, curved, zigzag) through configurable strategies
- **Queue analytics module**: Separate module for tracking queue metrics and statistics
- **Queue state machine diagram**: Document all possible states and transitions for queue processing

## Performance Optimizations

### High Priority
- **Spatial partitioning for queue detection**: Use grid or quadtree to quickly find nearby queues instead of checking all
- **Batch queue position updates**: Update all fans in a queue in a single batch operation
- **Cache distance calculations**: Many fans calculate distance to same queue positions - cache per frame
- **Lazy queue sorting**: Only sort queues when necessary (join/leave events), not every frame
- **Distance-based LOD for queues**: Far queues could use simplified logic or lower update rates
- **Pre-compute queue positions**: Calculate position grid once when queue is created, not per-fan
- **Throttle returning-to-queue updates**: Fans returning to end of queue don't need frequent position checks
- **Queue update frequency scaling**: Reduce update rate for stable queues (no recent changes)
- **Cull invisible queues**: Don't process queues that are off-screen or far from action
- **Optimize approaching list management**: Use Set instead of Array for faster lookups

### Medium Priority
- **Parallel queue processing**: Process multiple independent queues in parallel (Web Workers)
- **Incremental queue updates**: Only recalculate positions for affected fans, not entire queue
- **Queue position interpolation**: Smooth transitions between positions using interpolation
- **Shared approaching calculations**: Fans approaching same queue could share some calculations
- **Memory-efficient fan tracking**: Use typed arrays or more efficient data structures
- **Queue position prediction**: Predict where fans will be to reduce recalculation needs
- **Batch fan state transitions**: Group state changes and apply them in batches
- **Optimize queue length calculations**: Cache queue length + approaching length
- **Reduce object creation in hot paths**: Reuse position objects in update loops
- **Profile-guided optimization**: Measure which queue operations are slowest and optimize those first

### Low Priority
- **Queue compression for long queues**: Store position deltas instead of absolute positions
- **Streaming queue updates**: Update queue positions progressively over multiple frames
- **GPU-accelerated queue physics**: Use GPU for large-scale queue position calculations
- **Memory limits per queue**: Set maximum queue sizes to prevent memory issues
- **Queue data structure optimization**: Consider specialized data structures (circular buffers, etc.)

## Better Behavior

### Queue Joining
- **Natural approach angles**: Fans should approach from behind the queue, not cut through it
- **Personal space during approach**: Maintain distance from other fans while approaching
- **Queue choice intelligence**: Consider queue length, processing speed, and distance when choosing queues
- **Avoid queue crossing**: Fans shouldn't walk through other queues to reach their queue
- **Arrival time fairness**: Ensure first-come-first-served is respected even in approaching phase
- **Merge behavior**: When joining from the side, smoothly merge into queue line
- **Queue capacity awareness**: Show queue as "full" and discourage joining when too long
- **Dynamic queue selection**: Fans could switch queues if one becomes much shorter
- **Group queue joining**: Groups of fans should join queues together
- **Queue announcement**: Visual or state indication when fan decides to join a queue

### Queue Movement
- **Smooth position advancement**: Gradual movement forward, not teleporting between positions
- **Acceleration/deceleration in queues**: Speed up and slow down naturally when moving in queue
- **Position settling**: Small adjustments when reaching target position (not instant stop)
- **Maintain spacing**: Keep consistent distance from fan ahead and behind
- **Side-to-side variation**: Small lateral movement while in queue for natural appearance
- **Impatient animations**: Some fans could shift weight, look around, check phone
- **Queue density response**: Adjust spacing based on how crowded the queue is
- **Follow-the-leader logic**: Fan positions could be relative to fan ahead, not absolute
- **Collision-free advancement**: Ensure fans don't bump into each other when advancing
- **Predictive movement**: Start moving before target position changes (anticipate advancement)

### Queue Processing
- **Variable processing times**: Not all fans take same time (add personality-based variation)
- **Processing position variety**: Slight randomization in exact processing positions
- **Service animation variety**: Different "being served" animations or states
- **Multi-stage processing**: Some queues could have multiple steps (order, pay, receive)
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple service windows for busy queues
- **Express lanes**: Fast-pass or priority lanes for VIPs or simple orders
- **Processing interruptions**: Handle cases where processing is interrupted or fails
- **Queue splitting**: Long queues could dynamically split into multiple lines
- **Processing batching**: Serve multiple fans at once (group orders)
- **Dynamic processing speed**: Adjust based on queue length (faster when queue is long)

### Queue Exit
- **Natural exit paths**: Fans should move away from queue area after being served
- **Exit flow management**: Ensure exiting fans don't collide with entering fans
- **Clear exit indication**: Visual feedback when fan is done with queue
- **Exit speed variation**: Some fans linger, others rush away
