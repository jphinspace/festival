# Pathfinding Optimizations and Improvements

This document lists potential optimizations and improvements for the new pathfinding system.

## Code Style and Architecture

### Completed
- ✅ Separated pathfinding logic into dedicated module (`pathfinding.js`)
- ✅ Used pure functions for most pathfinding operations
- ✅ Modular design allows easy testing and modification
- ✅ Clear separation between static (obstacle avoidance) and dynamic (fan avoidance) waypoints

### Future Improvements
- **Extract configuration into pathfinding-specific config**: Move pathfinding constants (MAX_WAYPOINTS, BASE_UPDATE_INTERVAL, etc.) into a dedicated pathfinding config object
- **Add TypeScript definitions**: Create .d.ts files for better IDE support and type safety
- **Create pathfinding visualization tool**: Add debug mode that draws waypoints, paths, and obstacle buffers for easier debugging
- **Add pathfinding strategy pattern**: Allow different pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, simple geometric) to be swapped based on needs
- **Implement waypoint pooling**: Reuse waypoint objects instead of creating new ones to reduce garbage collection pressure

## Performance Optimizations

### High Priority
- **Cache obstacle collision checks**: Many agents check the same obstacles repeatedly. Cache results per frame
- **Spatial partitioning for obstacles**: Use quadtree or grid to quickly identify nearby obstacles instead of checking all obstacles
- **Limit pathfinding frequency**: Don't recalculate paths every frame - use the tick-based system more aggressively
- **Pre-compute common paths**: For frequent routes (security to center, food stalls, etc.), pre-compute and cache waypoints
- **Lazy waypoint calculation**: Only calculate the first 2-3 waypoints initially, calculate rest as needed
- **Distance-based LOD**: Fans far from camera/view could use simpler pathfinding

### Medium Priority
- **Parallel pathfinding**: Use Web Workers to calculate paths for multiple fans in parallel
- **Path smoothing**: After generating waypoints, smooth the path to reduce sharp turns
- **Waypoint merging**: If multiple waypoints are nearly collinear, merge them into one
- **Incremental path updates**: When environment changes slightly, update existing path instead of recalculating from scratch
- **Shared waypoints for groups**: Fans moving to same destination could share waypoint calculations

### Low Priority
- **Predictive pathfinding**: Predict where other fans will be and plan paths accordingly
- **Learning system**: Track which waypoints work best and prefer those routes
- **Memory limits**: Set max total waypoints across all agents to prevent memory issues

## Better Behavior

### Navigation

#### Completed
- ✅ **Personal space respect**: Personal space buffers factored into pathfinding collision detection
- ✅ **Obstacle prediction**: Fans use pathfinding around stationary obstacles

#### Future Improvements
- **Anticipatory avoidance**: Look further ahead to avoid getting into situations requiring sharp turns
- **Group behavior**: Fans traveling together should coordinate paths
- **Flow fields**: Use flow fields for large crowds moving to common destinations
- **Lane formation**: Encourage fans to form lanes when moving in opposite directions

### Queue Behavior

#### Completed
- ✅ **Natural queue joining**: Fans approach queues using pathfinding, positioning based on proximity to other fans
- ✅ **Queue density awareness**: Fans avoid cutting through dense queue areas via obstacle avoidance
- ✅ **Walking speed variation**: Fans use frame-independent movement with consistent speed

#### Future Improvements  
- **Processing position variety**: Vary processing positions slightly to look more natural
- **Impatient behavior**: Some fans could try to squeeze through gaps in queues (personality traits)

### State Transitions
- **Smoother state changes**: Add transition states between major states to make movement more fluid
- **Context-aware movement**: Movement speed and style should vary based on context (rushing to show vs. casual wandering)
- **Fatigue simulation**: Fans who have walked a lot might move slower or take shortcuts
- **Obstacle memory**: Remember recently encountered obstacles to avoid re-calculating paths to known blockages

## Resource Usage

### Memory
- **Waypoint limits**: Currently using up to 6 waypoints per fan. Consider reducing for fans far from obstacles
- **Garbage collection optimization**: Reuse object arrays instead of creating new ones
- **Waypoint compression**: Store waypoints as [x, y] arrays instead of {x, y} objects when possible
- **Remove unused data**: Clean up returningToQueue, processingAtStall, and other temporary properties when no longer needed

### CPU
- **Throttle pathfinding for idle fans**: Fans not moving don't need path updates
- **Update interval scaling**: Scale update intervals based on CPU load or fan count
- **Simplified collision for far fans**: Use bounding boxes instead of detailed collision for fans far from camera
- **Batch processing**: Process pathfinding for multiple fans in batches to improve cache performance

## Maintainability

### Code Organization
- **Separate collision detection module**: Extract collision logic from pathfinding and agent modules
- **Unit test coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Test complete scenarios (fan entering, getting food, watching show, leaving)
- **Performance benchmarks**: Automated tests that measure pathfinding performance
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments explaining the pathfinding algorithm choices

### Configuration
- **Runtime configuration**: Allow pathfinding parameters to be adjusted at runtime for tuning
- **Profile presets**: Easy/Normal/Hard profiles that adjust parameters for different performance needs
- **Per-fan configuration**: Allow different pathfinding settings for different fan types
- **A/B testing framework**: Test different pathfinding approaches side-by-side

## External Dependencies

### Potential Libraries
- **PathFinding.js**: Mature pathfinding library with multiple algorithms
- **Matter.js**: Physics engine that could handle collision detection more efficiently
- **QuadTree implementation**: For spatial partitioning of obstacles
- **Worker-threads**: For parallel pathfinding computation
- **IndexedDB**: For caching pre-computed paths between sessions

### Avoiding Dependencies
The project currently has zero runtime dependencies, which is excellent for:
- Load time
- Bundle size
- Security
- Maintenance

Consider carefully before adding dependencies. Many optimizations can be achieved with custom implementations.

## Logging and Debugging

### Information to Log
- **Path calculation time**: How long does it take to calculate a path?
- **Waypoint count distribution**: How many waypoints do fans typically use?
- **Recalculation frequency**: How often are paths being recalculated?
- **Collision detection hits**: How many collision checks per frame?
- **Failed pathfinding attempts**: Cases where no valid path could be found
- **Average path length**: Total distance fans travel

### Information to Display
- **Waypoint visualization**: Draw all active waypoints as colored dots
- **Path lines**: Draw lines showing each fan's planned path
- **Collision overlays**: Show obstacle buffers and collision zones
- **Performance metrics**: FPS, pathfinding time, active waypoint count
- **Agent states**: Color-code agents by their current state
- **Heat maps**: Show where agents spend most time, common bottlenecks

## Robustness Improvements

### Error Handling
- **Fallback paths**: If pathfinding fails, have a simple "move toward target" fallback
- **Stuck detection**: Detect when fans haven't moved in a while and unstick them
- **Invalid state recovery**: If fan ends up in invalid state, automatically recover
- **Timeout protection**: Limit pathfinding computation time to prevent hangs
- **Validation**: Validate waypoints are within canvas bounds and not inside obstacles

### Edge Cases
- **Multiple fans reaching same waypoint**: Handle collision when waypoints overlap
- **Moving obstacles**: If obstacles could move, update paths dynamically
- **Canvas resize**: Ensure paths remain valid when canvas dimensions change
- **State rollback**: Ability to undo state changes if they led to invalid situations
- **Queue capacity limits**: Handle what happens when queues get very long

## Consistency Improvements

### Movement

#### Completed
- ✅ **Smooth interpolation**: Waypoint-based pathfinding with randomization prevents sharp turns and crowding
- ✅ **Collision response**: Agents slide along obstacles naturally (Agent.findAvoidancePosition, resolveOverlap)

#### Future Improvements
- **Velocity-based movement**: Use velocity vectors for more realistic physics
- **Acceleration/deceleration**: Don't instantly reach top speed or stop (currently instant)
- **Turning radius**: Limit how sharply fans can turn (more natural movement)

### Queue Management

#### Completed
- ✅ **Consistent spacing**: QueueManager uses QUEUE_SPACING for even spacing in queues
- ✅ **No queue jumping**: Distance-based ordering strictly enforces queue order
- ✅ **Smooth queue progression**: Fans move gradually via pathfinding waypoints (no sudden jumps)

#### Future Improvements
- **Priority queues**: VIP fans or ticket holders could have separate queues
- **Queue overflow handling**: What happens when queues exceed capacity?

### State Management
- **Clear state machine**: Document all possible states and valid transitions
- **State invariants**: Define and check invariants for each state
- **Atomic state updates**: Ensure state changes happen completely or not at all
- **Event logging**: Log all state transitions for debugging
- **State visualization**: Show state machine diagram in documentation

## Testing Strategies
