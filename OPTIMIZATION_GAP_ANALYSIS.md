## Queue Management Optimizations

### Queue Joining

#### ✅ Already Completed
- **Merge behavior**: Proximity-based (60px threshold) positioning
- **Natural approach angles**: Pathfinding with obstacles
- **Personal space during approach**: Collision detection and personal space buffers
- **Arrival time fairness**: Distance-based sorting

#### ❌ Not Implemented

**1. Queue choice intelligence**
- **Current Behavior**: Fans choose queues based ONLY on distance to queue position
  - Security: Chooses closest queue (left vs right) based on fan's current X position
  - Food: Chooses side with fewer total fans (queue + approaching)
- **Recommended Behavior**: Consider multiple factors:
  - Queue length (total waiting)
  - Processing speed (how fast queue moves)
  - Distance to queue
- **Work Needed**: Add logic to calculate "effective wait time" = (queue_length × avg_processing_time) + travel_time
- **Code Location**: `SecurityQueue.addToQueue()` line 61, `FoodStall.addToQueue()` line 33

**2. Avoid queue crossing**
- **Current Behavior**: Pathfinding avoids obstacles, but doesn't specifically avoid cutting through OTHER queues
- **Recommended Behavior**: Treat other queues as obstacles to path around
- **Work Needed**: 
  - Add logic to identify queue areas (rectangles representing queue space)
  - Pass these as temporary obstacles to pathfinding when approaching a different queue
  - Or add penalty/cost to paths that cross queue areas
- **Code Location**: Pathfinding module, queue approach logic

**3. Queue capacity awareness**
- **Current Behavior**: Queues can grow infinitely, no upper limit
- **Recommended Behavior**: 
  - Show visual "FULL" indicator when queue exceeds threshold
  - Discourage/prevent fans from joining full queues
- **Work Needed**:
  - Add MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH config constant
  - Check length before allowing join
  - Visual indicator in renderer when queue is full
  - Alternative behavior for fans when all queues full (wait, leave, etc.)
- **Code Location**: Queue classes, renderer, fan decision logic

**4. Dynamic queue selection**
- **Current Behavior**: Once a fan chooses a queue, they're committed
- **Recommended Behavior**: Fans could switch to much shorter queue while approaching
- **Work Needed**:
  - Add periodic check while in APPROACHING_QUEUE state
  - Compare current queue target length vs other queue lengths
  - If difference exceeds threshold, switch queues
  - Handle state cleanup when switching
- **Code Location**: Queue update logic, fan state management

**5. Group queue joining**
- **Current Behavior**: All fans are independent, no group coordination
- **Recommended Behavior**: Fans traveling together join same queue
- **Work Needed**:
  - Add group/party system to track which fans are together
  - When one fan joins queue, others in group target same queue
  - Maintain proximity while in queue
  - Groups leave together
- **Code Location**: New group management system, fan relationships

  - Possibly a brief "deciding" state before APPROACHING_QUEUE
- **Code Location**: Renderer, fan state transitions

  - Fan targets position behind specific other fan
  - More organic movement, naturally adjusts to irregularities
  - Need to handle first fan in queue differently
- **Code Location**: Queue position calculation, major refactor

**12. Predictive movement**
- **Current Behavior**: Fans start moving when target position changes (throttled to 125ms)

- **Work Needed**:
  - Detect when fan ahead is moving
  - Start moving proactively before position update
  - Requires awareness of fan ahead's velocity/state
- **Code Location**: Queue update logic, agent update
